# Genome_Assembly_as_Shortest_Superstring
Current Project: This program aims to assemble individual strings of DNA into contiguous superstring over a collection of DNA.  Additionally, the program aims to construct the shortest superstring because of the biological principle that nature tends to take the shortest path in evolution.
